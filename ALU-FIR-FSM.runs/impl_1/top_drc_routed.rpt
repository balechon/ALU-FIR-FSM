2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u1/ns is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u1/FSM_onehot_ns_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell u1/FSM_onehot_ns_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u2/cont_reg[0]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u2/FSM_onehot_ps[2]_i_1/O, cell u2/FSM_onehot_ps[2]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT u2/FSM_onehot_ps[2]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
u1/FSM_onehot_ps_reg[0], u1/FSM_onehot_ps_reg[1], u1/FSM_onehot_ps_reg[2]
Related violations: <none>
